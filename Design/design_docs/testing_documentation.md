## 1. Introduction
### **Project Overview**:

This document outlines the testing strategy, test cases, and tools used to ensure the quality and reliability of QuizCraft.

### **Scope of Testing**: 
Since this is a frontend only application, the scope is limited to the frontend as well as the Gemini API.

### **Objectives**: 
<!-- Clearly state the objective of the tests, like ensuring functionality, security, performance, and reliability. -->

## 2. Test Strategy
### **Testing Levels**: 
Unit, integration, end-to-end

### **Testing Types**: 
Include functional testing (validating user flows), non-functional testing (performance, security), and API testing for third-party services.

## 3. Frontend Section
### **User Interface Tests**:
  - Check layout consistency across devices.
  - Validate form (e.g., quiz set up form).
  - Test for responsiveness and accessibility.
### **Functional Tests**:
  - Component Testing: Ensure each component renders and functions as expected (use Jest, React Testing Library).
### **User Interaction Tests**:
  - e.g. options menu, selecting answers

## 4. Performance Testing
- Test page load times and responsiveness.
- Test API response times and server load handling.

<!-- ## 6. Test Cases
List all test cases, detailing:
- **Test ID**: Unique identifier for each test.
- **Test Description**: Brief description of the functionality being tested.
- **Input Data**: Specific inputs used for the test.
- **Expected Result**: What should happen when the test is run.
- **Actual Result**: Outcome of the test (after execution).
- **Status**: Pass/Fail.

| Test ID | Test Description | Input Data | Expected Result | Actual Result | Status |
|---------|------------------|------------|-----------------|---------------|--------|
| T001    | User Registration | Valid email and password | User account created | User account created | Pass |
-->

## 5. Test Tools
- Jest
- React Testing Library
- GitHub Actions for CI/CD
<!--
## 8. Test Environment
- Specify the environments in which the tests are executed (local, staging, production).
- List all third-party APIs or services that need to be mocked during testing.

## 9. Test Schedule
- Outline milestones and deadlines for completing various testing phases.

## 10. Conclusion
- Include any assumptions, constraints, or dependencies related to testing.

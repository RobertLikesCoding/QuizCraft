# React State Design Document

## 1. Introduction
* **Purpose:** 
This document outlines the design and structure of React state management for the application. It details what data will be stored in component-level state, and what data will be elevated to React Context for global access.

It is intended for developers working on the application to understand how state is managed and shared across components.

* **Application Overview:** 
This is a React application with no backend that allows users to enter a prompt and a AI generated quiz will be generated based on the prompt. The application will have a simple UI with a form to enter the prompt and a quiz section to display the generated quiz.

## 2. State Management Strategy
* **Component-Level State:** 
<!-- Describe the type of data that will be managed within individual components using `useState` or `useReducer`. Provide examples. -->
* **React Context:** 
    <!-- Explain why React Context is being used and the benefits it provides in this application. -->
    * **Context Providers:** 
    <!-- List and describe the different Context Providers that will be used. -->
    * **Data Shared via Context:**  
    <!-- Detail the specific data points that will be stored within each Context. -->

## 3. State Structure
* **Component State Examples:**
    * **Component A:**
        * `data`: (data type) - Description of the data.
        * `loading`: (boolean) - Indicates whether data is being fetched.
        * `error`: (string) - Stores any error messages.
* **Context State Examples:**
    * **AuthContext:**
        * `user`: (object) - Stores user data (e.g., id, name, email).
        * `isLoggedIn`: (boolean) - Indicates user authentication status.
    * **ThemeContext:**
        * `theme`: (string) - Stores the current theme preference ('light' or 'dark').

## 4. State Interactions
* **Data Flow:** 
<!-- Illustrate the flow of data between components, Context Providers, and external data sources (e.g., APIs). -->
* **State Updates:**  
  <!-- Describe how state updates will be handled, including: -->
    * Event handlers within components.
    * API calls and data fetching.
    * Context dispatch functions.

## 5.  Performance Considerations
* **State Optimization:** 
  <!-- Discuss strategies for optimizing state management to ensure good performance. -->
    * Memoization techniques (e.g., `useMemo`, `React.memo`).
    * Selective re-renders.
    * Avoiding unnecessary state updates.

## 6.  Testing and Debugging
* **Testing Strategy:** 
  <!-- Briefly describe how the state management implementation will be tested. -->
* **Debugging Tools:**  
  <!-- Mention any tools or techniques that will be used for debugging state-related issues (e.g., React DevTools). -->

## 7. Future Considerations
* **Scalability:** 
  <!-- Discuss how the state management design can scale as the application grows. -->
* **Alternative Solutions:** 
  <!-- Briefly mention any alternative state management solutions that were considered (e.g., Redux, Zustand) and why they were not chosen. -->

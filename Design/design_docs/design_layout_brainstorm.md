# Design Layout Brainstorm

The purpose of this document is to brainstorm the layout of the design for the project. This will include the layout of the components and the overall design of the project. This will include possible sections for each page and what elements should be included in each. This will aid in the creation of wire frames and prototypes for the project.

## Site Intent

<!-- Due to how quickly end-user bounce can occur, the home page / landing page should be designed to quickly and effectively communicate the purpose of the site. The user should be able to quickly understand what the site is about and what they can do on the site. The user should be able to quickly navigate to the most important sections of the site. A clear navigation of the site should be present on the home page and there should be multiple avenues for the user to navigate to the most important sections of the site. -->

## Home Page

<!-- The home page will be the first page that the user sees when they visit the site. It should be designed to quickly provide the user with items they may purchase. This could be by means of suggestion or history of searching. The home page should also provide a way for the user to quickly find products they are looking for. This should be down though multiple means including: categories, product images and names, and others. -->

### Required sections

# QuizCraft

## Description

A quiz app where the user can decide the quiz topic by prompting the AI. The quizzes could be used for fun but also for practicing and studying (e.g. interview questions, exam questions etc.). Answers and questions are going to be in text based form.

It's supposed to be like a game rather than a website. Once your on the website you should be greeted and asked for a name. Afterwards you initiate the quiz with a topic and start the quiz.

## Features

* welcome screen asking for a topic
* input field for prompting the AI
* selector for setting the amount of questions
* Gemini API to generate questions with 3-4 possible answers
* give visual feedback for both wrong and right answers
* track the amount of wrong and right answers to create some kind of score
* visualize the results
* offer to start another quiz when a round is finished


## Tech Stack

* Gemini API(Model - Gemini 1.5 Flash)
* Vite (React)
* React Context for state
* Typescript
* HTML, SCSS
* Netlify (frontend hosting)


## Usage
1. Install the dependencies in the `root` folder with:
```bash
npm install
```
2. Create a `.env` file in `root` using the `.env.example` as a template

> **NOTE:**
> You can get your API key from the [Gemini API](https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api?gad_source=1&gclid=Cj0KCQjw7Py4BhCbARIsAMMx-_IbSjSUZIg4gAbOfmaRmAoGZFWrVv53JF4zEGSwxKRBkXcLFhCidqsaAhGmEALw_wcB&authuser=1) documentation. 

3. Within the `App.tsx` file, you can set your desired quiz subject and number of questions generated by changing the parameters within the `testQuizOutput()` function.
```typescript
    await testQuizOutput(4, "Frontend Web Development");
```
4. Call the run dev command
```bash
npm run dev
```
This will output the generated quiz questions and answers in the web dev console when the page is loaded. Visit `http://localhost:5173/` to view the page. Use F12 or right click and inspect or ctrl+shift+I to view the console.

The `generateQuiz()` function returns a `QuizResult` object with the following structure:
```typescript
interface QuizResult {
    quizTitle: string;
    questions: {
        questionText: string;
        options: string[];
        correctAnswerIndex: number;
    }[];
}
```

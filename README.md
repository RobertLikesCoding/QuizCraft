# QuizCraft

## AI Quiz Generation API feature

### Usage
1. Switch to the frontend directory:
```bash
cd frontend
```
2. Install the dependencies with:
```bash
npm install
```
3. Create a `frontend/.env` file with the following content:
```bash
GEMINI_API_KEY=your_api_key
```
> **NOTE:**
> You can get your API key from the [Gemini API](https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api?gad_source=1&gclid=Cj0KCQjw7Py4BhCbARIsAMMx-_IbSjSUZIg4gAbOfmaRmAoGZFWrVv53JF4zEGSwxKRBkXcLFhCidqsaAhGmEALw_wcB&authuser=1) documentation. 
> You can also use the .env.example file as a template.
4. Within the `api.ts` util file, you can set your desired quiz subject and number of questions generated by changing the parameters within the `test()` function.
```typescript
const testObject: QuizResult | undefined = await generateQuiz(
        3, // Number of questions
        "Passport.js" // Quiz subject
    )
```
5. Compile the typescript. TypeScript was installed locally using --save-dev, so you can run the following command:
```bash
npx tsc
```
This will create a `dist` directory with the compiled JavaScript files as set in the `tsconfig.json` file.
6. Depending on you location in the terminal, you can run the compiled JavaScript file with one of these commands:
```bash
node api.js
```
```bash
node dist/api.js
```
```bash
node frontend/dist/api.js
```
This will output the generated quiz questions and answers in the terminal as seen in the `test()` function. The `generateQuiz()` function returns a `QuizResult` object with the following structure:
```typescript
interface QuizResult {
    quizTitle: string;
    questions: {
        questionText: string;
        options: string[];
        correctAnswerIndex: number;
    }[];
}
```
